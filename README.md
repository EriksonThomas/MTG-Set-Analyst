I am an avid Magic the Gathering (MTG) enthusiast and collector, so over my many years of playing I have collected thousands of cards, using them to create a plethora of decks that are fun to battle with. For this project, I wanted to mix two of my interests and write a Python script that would scrape (extract data from) a well-known MTG website for querying cards. 

Simply input the three character MTG set symbol and watch MAGIC happen!
